# Question: The Distracted Bakers  

A famous baking crew, *The Distracted Bakers*, is coming to your town for a grand live baking show. These bakers are incredibly skilled but have a reputation for being forgetful and easily distracted. They frequently lose track of time, forget which ingredients they’re using, and sometimes even wander off in the middle of baking.  

During the show, each baker will need to take a break at some point. However, if three or more bakers take a break simultaneously, chaos ensues—flour flies everywhere, cakes collapse, and the remaining bakers panic, ruining their recipes.  

The show will last for a certain number of minutes, during which each of the bakers will take a break. The duration of each baker’s break is predetermined.  

Your task is to help the event organizer schedule the bakers’ breaks so that at no point are three or more of them absent at the same time. Each break must occur entirely within the show’s duration.  

## Input  
The first line contains two integers:  
- **C** (1 ≤ **C** ≤ 1000) — the duration of the baking show in minutes  
- **B** (1 ≤ **B** ≤ 1000) — the number of bakers in the crew  

The second line contains **B** integers, where each value represents the duration (in minutes) of a specific baker's break. Each value is between **1** and **C-1** (inclusive).  

> **Note:** The input guarantees that a valid schedule exists, though multiple valid schedules may be possible.

## Output  
For each baker, output one integer: the number of minutes they will work before taking a break. Output the values in the same order as the input.  

## Example  

### Sample Input 1  
```
8 3  
4 4 4  
```
### Sample Output 1  
```
0 2 4  
```  

### Sample Input 2 
```
10 5  
7 5 1 2 3  
```
### Sample Output 2
```
3 3 9 0 0  
```


## Given Code
```cpp

    int n,time; std::cin >> time >> n;

    std::pair<int,int> temp[n];
    for (int i=0; i<n;i++){
        int a; std::cin >> a;
        temp[i] = std::make_pair(a,i);
    }
    std::sort(temp,temp+n);

    int res[n];
    int ch1 = 0, ch2 = 0;
    bool flag = 1;
    for (int i=n-1; i>=0;i--){
        int a = temp[i].first, b = temp[i].second;
        if (flag and (ch1+a)<=time){
            res[b] = ch1; ch1 += a;
            flag = 0;
        }else if (!flag and (ch2+a)<=time){
            res[b] = ch2; ch2 += a;
            flag = 1;
        }else if ((ch1+a)<=time){
            res[b] = ch1; ch1 += a;
            flag = 0;
        }else if ((ch2+a)<=time){
            res[b] = ch2; ch2 += a;
            flag = 1;
        }
    }

    for (auto &x: res) std::cout << x << ' '; std::cout << std::endl;
    return 0;
